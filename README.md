# Building secure, usable dApps on EVM

Designing smart contracts with real UX, invariants, and frontend flows that make sense.

## Focus now
- TriaEscrow — P2P escrow built with Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, Server Actions, and Solidity with Foundry.
- Learning De-Fi from a smart contract engineering perspective
- Security research in EVM

## Toolbox
`Solidity` `Foundry` `TypeScript` `viem` `wagmi` `HTML/CSS/JS` `SQL`

## Open to
- Smart contract audits, hardening, security bounties.
- Web3 integrations with viem/wagmi, and EVM multichain deployments.
